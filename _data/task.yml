- task: The communication module with libp2p as the bottom layer is implemented in XDAG, and NAT penetration function and node discovery function are added. The libp2p communication protocol has high reliability and security, and is a must for mainstream blockchain projects to build a P2P environment. The realization of this agreement will greatly facilitate the future expansion of XDAG's network scale, enhance network stability, and pave the way for XDAG to remove the whitelist.
